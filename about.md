Linux DevOps engineer with a focus on AWS. Studying Msc Infosec in 2018 to improve my infosec theory for better application in development and DevOps. I love all things Python with a interest in Golang and Rust. React is pretty neat so far and getting into Ionic for work, somehow the javascript community convinced me to give it another try.
