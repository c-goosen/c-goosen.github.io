title: Finally my blog is up and running!
---

This should be familiar to some, but the delay in getting this running is combination of procrastinating and over engineering the solution. Github pages with Jeckyll makes building a blog much easier than some tutorials would make you believe. Definitely over engineering running mongo/mysql, flask and a seperate frontend for a simple blog. Even though I like the challenge to build a blog in react, this solution makes sense as updates will be infrequent and builds are handled for me.

This blog is primarily for writing down technical snippets on work that ive done. This will allow me to share the experience and have a place to refresh my memory. If this helps anyone great, if you wish to share or use the info, go ahead! Knowledge hoarded is knowledge lost with the sands of time.
