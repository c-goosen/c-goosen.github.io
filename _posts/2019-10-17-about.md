Currently a business owner and DevOps/Security consultant.

Previously a CTO at a Insurance Tech startup. I get to build incredibily interesting tools for a established and rigid indistry. Linux DevOps engineer with a focus on AWS. Studying Msc in Infosec in to further my interest and passion for the subject. I love all things Python with a interest in Golang and Rust. React is pretty neat so far and getting into Ionic for work, somehow the javascript community convinced me to give it another try. 

When I have the time I love to teach others tech and the possiblities of tech. Hackathons, conferences and meetups inspires me to improve exponentially and cross polinate skills with others.

Technology is a equalising force, and with the inpiration of so many open source communities, I aim to inspire more people than the projects I code. I feel all the tech knowledge and power is lost without attempting to change the world for the better.

### Inspiration

Greed is exponential to the self, generosity is exponential towards the many.


### Photography

My hobby (and occasionally encrouches on work) is photography and at the moment my work is only showcased on instagram: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/goosenaroundphoto/).

I enjoying shooting with a [Fujifilm XT-20](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t20/) with a continuously growing number of lenses. XC 15-45MM lens as well as various Canon lenses with XF converter mount.
